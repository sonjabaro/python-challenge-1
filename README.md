# python-challenge-1
challenge number 2
This is a challenge to create an order system.  The resources I used included zoom recordings, class activities information/repeats, Chat GPT and fellow class mates to help.  Unfortunately I didn't get all the elements in the rubric I believe. But it's a start for this newbie to coding.
